You can quickly set up NFS access for ESXi hosts to datastores using ONTAP volumes.

You should use this procedure if you want to configure NFS access for ESXi hosts to a volume in the following way:

* You are working with clusters running ONTAP 9.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You want to use to provision a datastore and create a volume.
* You want to use the _Classic_ System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases, not the ONTAP System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and later.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/[ONTAP System Manager documentation^]

* Your data network uses the default IPspace, the default broadcast domain, and the default failover group.
+
If your data network is flat, these default objects prescribe that LIFs will fail over correctly in the event of a link failure. If you are not using the default objects, you should refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/index.html[Network Management] for information about how to configure LIF path failover.

* You want to use the Plug-In for VMware VAAI.
+
VMware vStorage APIs for Array Integration (VAAI) enable you to perform copy offload and space reservations. The Plug-In for VMware VAAI uses this to improve host performance because operations do not need to go through the ESXi host, thereby taking advantage of space- and time-efficient cloning in ONTAP.
+
Using VMware VAAI for datastore provisioning is a best practice.

* NFS access will be through NFSv3 and NFSv4 for use with VMware VAAI.

If this procedure is not suitable for your situation, you should see the following documentation instead:
