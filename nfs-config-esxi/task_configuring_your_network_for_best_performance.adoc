Ethernet networks vary greatly in performance. You can maximize the performance of the network by selecting specific configuration values.

== Steps

. Connect the host and storage ports to the same network.
+
It is best to connect to the same switches.

. Select the highest speed ports available.
+
10 GbE or faster ports are best. 1 GbE ports are the minimum.

. Enable jumbo frames if desired and supported by your network.
+
Jumbo frames should have an MTU of 9000 for ESXi hosts and storage systems and 9216 for most switches.
+
All devices in the data path, including ESXi NICs, storage NICs, and switches, must support jumbo frames.
