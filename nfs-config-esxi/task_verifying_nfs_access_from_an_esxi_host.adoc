After you have provisioned a datastore, you can verify that the ESXi host has NFS access by creating a virtual machine on the datastore and powering it on.

. From the vSphere Web Client *Home* page, click *Hosts and Clusters*.
. In the navigation pane, expand the datacenter to locate the datastore you previously created.
. Click *Create a new virtual machine* and provide the required information in the wizard.
+
To verify NFS access, you should select the datacenter, ESXi host, and datastore that you previously created.

The virtual machine appears in the vSphere Web Client inventory.

. Power on the virtual machine.
