The ports you created for iSCSI must be associated with the iSCSI software adapter to support multipathing.

* The iSCSI VMkernel ports must be created.
* The iSCSI software adapter must be enabled on the ESX host.

You can bind the iSCSI ports using the vSphere Client.

For detailed instructions, see _VMware vSphere Storage_ for your version of ESXi 5 from VMware.
