[.lead]
You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to quiesce a destination volume to stabilize the destination before creating a Snapshot copy. The quiesce operation enables active data transfers to finish and disables future transfers for the mirror and vault relationship.

.Before you begin

The mirror and vault relationship must be in a Snapmirrored state.

.Steps

. Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the mirror and vault relationship that you want to quiesce, and then click *Operations* > *Quiesce*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Quiesce*.

.Results

If there is no transfer in progress, the transfer status is displayed as Quiesced. If a transfer is in progress, the transfer is not affected, and the transfer status is displayed as Quiescing until the transfer is complete.
