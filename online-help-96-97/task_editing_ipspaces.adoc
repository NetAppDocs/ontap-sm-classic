You can use System Manager to rename an existing IPspace.

* All IPspace names must be unique within a cluster and must not consist of names that are reserved by the system, such as local or localhost.
* The system-defined "`Default`" IPspace and "`Cluster`" IPspace cannot be modified.

. Click *Network* > *IPspaces*.
. Select the IPspace that you want to modify, and then click *Edit*.
. In the *Edit IPspace* dialog box, specify a new name for the IPspace.
. Click *Rename*.
