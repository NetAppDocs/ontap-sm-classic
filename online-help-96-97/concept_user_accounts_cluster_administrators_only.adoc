You can create, modify, lock, unlock, or delete a cluster user account, reset a user's password, or display information about all user accounts.

You can manage cluster user accounts in the following ways:

* Creating a login method for a user by specifying the user's account name, the access method, the authentication method, and, optionally, the access-control role that the user is assigned
* Displaying users' login information, such as the account name, allowed access method, authentication method, access-control role, and account status
* Modifying the access-control role that is associated with a user's login method
+
[NOTE]
====
It is best to use a single role for all the access and authentication methods of a user account.
====

* Deleting a user's login method, such as the access method or the authentication method
* Changing the password for a user account
* Locking a user account to prevent the user from accessing the system
* Unlocking a previously locked user account to enable the user to access the system again
