You can use System Manager to create, edit, and delete volumes.

You can access all the volumes in the cluster by using the Volumes tab or you can access the volumes specific to an SVM by using *SVMs* > *Volumes*.

[NOTE]
====
The Volumes tab is displayed only if you have enabled the CIFS and NFS licenses.
