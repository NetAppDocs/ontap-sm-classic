You can create a subnet by using System Manager to provide a logical subdivision of an IP network to pre-allocate the IP addresses. A subnet enables you to create interfaces more easily by specifying a subnet instead of an IP address and network mask values for each new interface.

You must have created the broadcast domain on which the subnet is used.

If you specify a gateway when creating a subnet, a default route to the gateway is added automatically to the SVM when a LIF is created using that subnet.

. Click the *Network* tab.
. In the *Subnets* tab, click *Create*.
. In the *Create Subnet* dialog box, specify subnet details, such as the name, subnet IP address or subnet mask, range of IP addresses, gateway address, and broadcast domain.
+
You can specify the IP addresses as a range, as comma-separated multiple addresses, or as a mix of both.

. Click *Create*.
