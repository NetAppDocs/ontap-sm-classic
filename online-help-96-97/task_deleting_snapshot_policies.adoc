You can use System Manager to delete Snapshot policies. If you delete a Snapshot policy that is being used by one or more volumes, Snapshot copies of the volume or volumes are no longer created according to the deleted policy.

You must have dissociated the Snapshot policy from each volume that uses it.

. Click *Protection* > *Snapshot Policies*.
. Select the Snapshot policy and click *Delete*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Delete*.
