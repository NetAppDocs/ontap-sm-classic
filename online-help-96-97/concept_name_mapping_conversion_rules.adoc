summary: 'An ONTAP system keeps a set of conversion rules for each SVM. Each rule consists of two pieces: a pattern and a replacement. Conversions start at the beginning of the appropriate list and perform a substitution based on the first matching rule. The pattern is a UNIX-style regular expression. The replacement is a string containing escape sequences representing subexpressions from the pattern, as in the UNIX sed program.'

An ONTAP system keeps a set of conversion rules for each SVM. Each rule consists of two pieces: a _pattern_ and a _replacement_. Conversions start at the beginning of the appropriate list and perform a substitution based on the first matching rule. The pattern is a UNIX-style regular expression. The replacement is a string containing escape sequences representing subexpressions from the pattern, as in the UNIX `sed` program.
