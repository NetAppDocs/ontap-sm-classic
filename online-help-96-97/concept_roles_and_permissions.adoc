The cluster administrator can restrict a user's access to only a specified set of commands by creating a restricted access-control role and then assigning the role to a user.

You can manage access-control roles in the following ways:

* By creating an access-control role, and then specifying the command or command directory that the role's users can access.
* By controlling the level of access that the role has for the command or command directory, and then specifying a query that applies to the command or command directory.
* By modifying an access-control role's access to a command or command directory.
* By displaying information about access-control roles, such as the role name, the command or command directory that a role can access, the access level, and the query.
* By deleting an access-control role.
* By restricting a user's access to only a specified set of commands.
* By displaying ONTAP APIs and their corresponding command-line interface (CLI) commands.
