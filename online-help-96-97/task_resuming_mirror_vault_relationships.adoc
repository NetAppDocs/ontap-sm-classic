[.lead]
If you have a quiesced mirror and vault relationship, you can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to resume the relationship. When you resume the relationship, normal data transfer to the destination volume is resumed and all the protection activities are restarted.

.About this task

If you have quiesced a broken mirror and vault relationship from the command-line interface (CLI), you cannot resume the relationship from System Manager. You must use the CLI to resume the relationship.

.Steps

. Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the mirror and vault relationship that you want to resume, and then click *Operations* > *Resume*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Resume*.

.Results

Normal data transfers are resumed. If there is a scheduled transfer for the relationship, the transfer is started from the next schedule.
