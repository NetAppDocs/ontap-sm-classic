Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) is a new model for connecting hosts to storage systems. Like the traditional FC protocol, FCoE maintains existing FC management and controls, but it uses a 10-gigabit Ethernet network as the hardware transport.

Setting up an FCoE connection requires one or more supported converged network adapters (CNAs) in the host, connected to a supported data center bridging (DCB) Ethernet switch. The CNA is a consolidation point and effectively serves as both an HBA and an Ethernet adapter.

In general, you can configure and use FCoE connections the same way you use traditional FC connections.
