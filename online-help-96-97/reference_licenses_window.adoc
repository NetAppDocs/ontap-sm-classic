Your storage system arrives from the factory with preinstalled software. If you want to add or remove a software license after you receive the storage system, you can use the Licenses window.

[NOTE]
====
System Manager does not monitor evaluation licenses and does not provide any warning when an evaluation license is nearing expiry. An evaluation license is a temporary license that expires after a certain period of time.
