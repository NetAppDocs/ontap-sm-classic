You can use System Manager to assign unassigned array LUNs to an existing aggregate to increase the size of the aggregate.

== About this task

* You can assign array LUNs if the following conditions are true:
 ** The container type of the selected array LUNs must be "`unassigned`".
 ** The disks must be connected to nodes in an HA pair.
 ** The disks must be visible to the node.
* For MetroCluster configurations, you cannot use System Manager to assign array LUNs as spares.
+
You must use the command-line interface instead.

== Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Aggregates & Disks* > *Array LUNs*.
. Select the array LUNs, and then click *Assign*.
. In the *Assign Array LUNs* dialog box, select the node to which you want to assign the array LUNs.
. Click *Assign*.
