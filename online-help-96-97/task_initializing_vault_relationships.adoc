You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to initialize a vault relationship if you have not already initialized it while creating the relationship. A baseline transfer of data is initiated from the source FlexVol volume to the destination FlexVol volume.

.Before you begin

The source and destination clusters must be in a healthy peer relationship.

.Steps

. Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the relationship you want to initialize, and click *Operations* > *Initialize*.
. In the *Initialize* window, click *Initialize*.

.Results

A Snapshot copy is created and transferred to the destination.

This Snapshot copy is used as a baseline for subsequent incremental Snapshot copies.
