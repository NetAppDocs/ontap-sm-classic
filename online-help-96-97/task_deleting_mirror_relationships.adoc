You can delete a mirror relationship and permanently end the mirror relationship between the source and destination volumes. When a mirror relationship is deleted, the base Snapshot copy on the source volume is deleted.

It is a best practice to break the mirror relationship before deleting the relationship.

. Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the mirror relationship that you want to delete and click *Delete*.
. Select the confirmation check boxes to delete the mirror relationship and to release the base Snapshot copies, and then click *Delete*.

The relationship is deleted, and the base Snapshot copy on the source volume is deleted.
