You can use a passphrase to authorize peering requests. You can use a custom passphrase or a system-generated passphrase for cluster peering.

* You can generate a passphrase on the remote cluster.
* The minimum required length for a passphrase is eight characters.
* The passphrase is generated based on the IPspace.
* If you are using a system-generated passphrase for cluster peering, after you enter the passphrase in the initiator cluster, peering is authorized automatically.
* If you are using a custom passphrase for cluster peering, you have to navigate to the remote cluster to complete the peering process.
