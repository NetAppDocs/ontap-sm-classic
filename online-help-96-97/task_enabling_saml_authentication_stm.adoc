You can use System Manager to configure Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication so that remote users can log in by using a secure identity provider (IdP).

* The IdP that you plan to use for remote authentication must be configured.
+
[NOTE]
====
See the documentation that is provided by the IdP that you have configured.
====

* You must have the URI of the IdP.

The IdPs that have been validated with System Manager are Shibboleth and Active Directory Federation Services.

[NOTE]
====
After SAML authentication is enabled, only remote users can access the System Manager GUI. Local users cannot access the System Manager GUI after SAML authentication is enabled.
====

. Click *Configuration* > *Cluster* > *Authentication*.
. Select the *Enable SAML authentication* check box.
. Configure System Manager to use SAML authentication:
 .. Enter the URI of the IdP.
 .. Enter the IP address of the host system.
 .. If required, change the host system certificate.
. Click *Retrieve Host Metadata* to retrieve the host URI and host metadata information.
. Copy the host URI or host metadata details, access your IdP, and then specify the host URI or host metadata details and the trust rules in the IdP window.
+
[NOTE]
====
See the documentation that is provided by the IdP that you have configured.
====

. Click *Save*.
+
The IdP login window is displayed.

. Log in to System Manager by using the IdP login window.
+
After the IdP is configured, if the user tries to log in by using the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), IPv6, or a cluster management LIF, then the system automatically changes the IP address to the IP address of the host system that was specified during the IdP configuration.
