You can use ONTAP System Manager classic (available in ONTAP 9.7 and earlier) to initialize a mirror and vault relationship if you have not already initialized the relationship while creating it. When you initialize a relationship, a complete baseline transfer of data is performed from the source volume to the destination.

.Before you begin

The source and destination clusters must be in a healthy peer relationship.

.Steps

. Click *Protection* > *Volume Relationships*.
. Select the mirror and vault relationship that you want to initialize, and then click *Operations* > *Initialize*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Initialize*.
. Verify the status of the relationship in the *Protection* window.

.Results

A Snapshot copy is created and transferred to the destination.

This Snapshot copy is used as a baseline for subsequent incremental Snapshot copies.
