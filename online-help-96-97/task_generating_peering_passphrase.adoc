Beginning with System Manager 9.6, you can generate a passphrase for the local cluster IPspace and use the same passphrase in the remote cluster when creating peering relationships.

.Steps

. Click *Configuration* > *Cluster Peers*.
. Click *Generate Peering Passphrase*.
+
The Generate Peering Passphrase dialog window displays.

. Complete the following fields:
 ** *IPspace*: Select the IPspace from the pull-down menu.
 ** *Passphrase Validity*: Select from the drop-down menu the duration for which you want the passphrase to be valid.
 ** *SVM Permissions*: Select one of the following:
  *** *All SVMs* to indicate all SVMs are permitted to access the cluster.
  *** *Selected SVMs* to indicate specific SVMs that are permitted to access the cluster. Highlight the SVM names in the field that you want to specify.
. Select the checkbox if the effective cluster version of the remote cluster is earlier than ONTAP 9.6. Otherwise, the cluster peering fails to generate.
. Click *Generate* to generate the passphrase.
