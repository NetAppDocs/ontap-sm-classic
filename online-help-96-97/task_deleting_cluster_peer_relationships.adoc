. Select the cluster peer for which you want to delete the relationship, and then click *Delete*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Delete*.
. Log in to the remote cluster, and perform Steps <<STEP_313E6AFE5C2B4D8C9E9723FAF1F8534A,1>> through <<STEP_24E41EC7F4E746D09897FC2DCBEC0E18,3>> to delete the peer relationship between the local cluster and the remote cluster.
