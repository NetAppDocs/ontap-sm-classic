Starting with System Manager 9.6, when you edit a FlexCache volume, you can specify the advanced options that you want to associate with the FlexCache volume.

. In the *Edit FlexCache volume* window, click image:../media/advanced_options.gif[] to specify the advanced options.
+
The Advanced Options window displays. It contains sections (the headings in the left column), in which you can specify various options.

. In the *General Details* section, you can edit the permissions for the volume.
. In the *Aggregates* section, you can enable the *Select Aggregates* toggle button to override the best practices defaults and select your choices from a list of aggregates.
. In the *Storage Efficiency* section, you can enable compression and deduplication on the volume.
+
Deduplication is not enabled by default for FlexCache volumes. System Manager uses the default deduplication schedule if the specified volume size exceeds the limit that is required for running deduplication.

. Click *Apply* to update the changes.
