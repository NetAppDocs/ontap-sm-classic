An efficiency policy is a job schedule for a deduplication operation on a FlexVol volume.

You can run deduplication on a FlexVol volume either by scheduling the operations to start at a specific time or by specifying that the operations are triggered if a threshold percentage is exceeded. You can schedule a deduplication operation by creating job schedules that are enclosed within the efficiency policies. The volume efficiency policies support only job schedules that are of type cron. Alternately, you can specify a threshold percentage. When new data exceeds the specified percentage, the deduplication operation is started.
