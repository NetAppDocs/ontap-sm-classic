[.lead]
Storage QoS controls workloads that are assigned to policy groups by throttling and prioritizing client operations (SAN and NAS data requests) and system operations.

The following illustration shows a sample environment before and after using Storage QoS. On the left, workloads compete for cluster resources to transmit I/O. These workloads get "`best effort`" performance, which means that you have less performance predictability (for example, a workload might get such good performance that it negatively impacts other workloads). On the right, the same workloads are assigned to policy groups that enforce maximum throughput limits.

The `-max-throughput` parameter specifies the maximum throughput limit for the policy group that the policy group must not exceed. The value of this parameter is specified in terms of IOPS or MB/s, or a combination of comma-separated IOPS and MB/s values, and the range is zero to infinity.

The units are base 10. There should be no space between the number and the unit. The default value for the `-max-throughput` parameter is `infinity`, which is specified by the special value INF.

[NOTE]
====
There is no default unit for the `-max-throughput` parameter. For all values except zero and infinity, you must specify the unit.
====

The keyword "`none`" is available for a situation that requires the removal of a value. The keyword "`INF`" is available for a situation that requires the maximum available value to be specified. Examples of valid throughput specifications are: ""`100B/s`"", "`10KB/s`", "`1gb/s`", "`500MB/s`", "`1tb/s`", "`100iops`", "`100iops,400KB/s`", and "`800KB/s,100iops`".
