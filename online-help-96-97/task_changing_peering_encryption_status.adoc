You can use System Manager to change the peering encryption status for the selected cluster.

== About this task

The encryption status can be enabled or disabled. You can change the status from enabled to disabled or from disabled to enabled by selecting *Change Encryption*.

== Steps

. Click *Configuration* > *Cluster Peers*.
. Select the peered cluster, and click *Edit*
+
The drop-down menu displays.

. Click *Change Encryption*.
+
This action is not available if the encryption status is "`N/A`".
+
The Change Encryption dialog window displays. The toggle button indicates the current encryption status.

. Slide the toggle button to change the peering encryption status and proceed.
 ** If the current encryption status is "`none`", you can enable encryption by sliding the toggle button to change the status to "`tls_psk`".
 ** If the current encryption status is "`tls_psk`", you can disable the encryption by sliding the toggle button to change the status to "`none`".
. After you enable or disable peering encryption, you can either generate a new passphrase and provide it at the peered cluster or you can apply an existing passphrase that was already generated at the peered cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the passphrase used on the local site does not match the passphrase used on the remote site, the cluster peering relationship will not function properly.

Select one of the following:

 ** *Generate a passphrase*: Proceed to Step <<STEP_1ABAF15926174E709CA59192E200ABE3,#STEP_1ABAF15926174E709CA59192E200ABE3>>.
 ** *Already have a passphrase*: Proceed to Step <<STEP_2EFD822431974811AD2260C3F31DC977,#STEP_2EFD822431974811AD2260C3F31DC977>>.

. If you chose *Generate a passphrase*, complete the necessary fields:
 ** *IPspace*: Select the IPspace from the drop-down menu.
 ** *Passphrase Validity*: Select from the drop-down menu the duration for which you want the passphrase to be valid.
 ** *SVM Permissions*: Select one of the following:
  *** *All SVMs* to indicate that all SVMs are permitted to access the cluster.
  *** *Selected SVMs* to indicate specific SVMs that are permitted to access the cluster. Highlight the SVM names in the field that you want to specify.
. Select the checkbox if the effective cluster version of the remote cluster is earlier than ONTAP 9.6. Otherwise, the passphrase fails to generate.
. Click *Apply*.
+
The passphrase is generated for the relationship and displayed. You can either copy the passphrase or email it.
+
The authentication status for the local cluster is displayed as `ok_and_offer` for the selected passphrase validity period until you provide the passphrase at the remote cluster.

. If you already generated a new passphrase in the remote cluster, then perform the following substeps:
 .. Click *Already have a passphrase*.
 .. Enter in the *Passphrase* field the same passphrase that was generated in the remote cluster.
 .. Click *Apply*.
