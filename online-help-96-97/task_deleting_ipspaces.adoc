You can use System Manager to delete an IPspace when you no longer require the IPspace.

The IPspace that you want to delete must not be associated with any broadcast domains, network interfaces, peer relationships, or storage virtual machines (SVMs).

The system-defined "`Default`" IPspace and "`Cluster`" IPspace cannot be deleted.

. Click *Network* > *IPspaces*.
. Select the IPspace that you want to delete, and then click *Delete*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Yes*.
