Using the Storage window, you can review the storage recommendations that are provided for creating aggregates.

You must have set up the cluster, network, and the support details.

You can create data aggregates per the storage recommendations or you can skip this step and create data aggregates at a later time using System Manager.

* To create data aggregates as per the storage recommendations, click *Submit and Continue*.
* To create data aggregates at a later time using System Manager, click *Skip this step*.

If you opted to create aggregates per the storage recommendations, you must create a storage virtual machine (SVM) to continue with the cluster setup.
