If you want to use Kerberos authentication for client access, you must configure the storage virtual machine (SVM) to use an existing Kerberos realm. You can use System Manager to create a Kerberos realm configuration, which enables SVMs to use Kerberos security services for NFS.

* The CIFS license must be installed if CIFS shares are used, and the NFS license must be installed if an LDAP server is used.
* Active Directory (Windows 2003 or Windows 2008) with DES MD5 encryption capability must be available.
* You must have set the time zone and synchronized the time across the cluster by configuring NTP.
+
This prevents authentication errors, and ensures that the timestamps in log files are consistent across the cluster.

While creating a Kerberos realm, you must set the following attributes in the Create Kerberos Realm wizard:

* Kerberos realm
* KDC IP address and port number
+
The default port number is 88.

* Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) vendor
* Administrative server IP address if the KDC vendor is not Microsoft
* Password server IP address
* Active Directory server name and IP address if the KDC vendor is Microsoft

. Click *Storage* > *SVMs*.
. Select the SVM, and then click *SVM Settings*.
. In the *Services* pane, click *Kerberos Realm*.
. In the *Kerberos Realm* window, click *Create*.
. Type or select information as prompted by the wizard.
. Confirm the details, and then click *Finish* to complete the wizard.
