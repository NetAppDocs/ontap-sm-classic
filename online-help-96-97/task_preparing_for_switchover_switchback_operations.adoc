Before you perform switchover operations using ONTAP System Manager classic 9.6, you should verify that the necessary steps have been performed on the affected site.

.Steps

. If you are recovering from a disaster on Site B, you must perform the following steps:
 .. Repair or replace any damaged disks or hardware.
 .. Restore power.
 .. Rectify error issues that occur.
 .. Bring up the disaster site.
. Ensure the following conditions exist in your cluster:
 ** Both sites are in Active state if you are performing a planned switchover.
 ** The MetroCluster system uses configuration type "`IP_Fabric`".
 ** Both sites are operating with a two-node configuration (two nodes in each cluster). Sites with a single-node or four-node configuration are not supported for switchover and switchback operations using System Manager.
. If you are launching the remote site (Site B) from the local site (Site A), ensure that Site B is running System Manager 9.6 or a later version.
