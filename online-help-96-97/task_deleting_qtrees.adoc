You can delete a qtree and reclaim the disk space that the qtree uses within a volume by using System Manager. When you delete a qtree, all of the quotas that are applicable to that qtree are no longer applied by ONTAP.

== Before you begin

* The qtree status must be normal.
* The qtree must not contain any LUN.

== Steps

. Click *Storage* > *Qtrees*.
. In the *Qtrees* window, select one or more qtrees that you want to delete, and then click *Delete*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Delete*.
. Verify that the qtree that you deleted is no longer included in the list of qtrees in the *Qtrees* window.
