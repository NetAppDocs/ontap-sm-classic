You can configure many tasks (for instance, volume Snapshot copies and mirror replications) to run on specified schedules. Schedules that are run at specified schedules are known as _cron_ schedules because of their similarity to UNIX `cron` schedules. Schedules that are run at intervals are known as _interval_ schedules.

You can manage schedules in the following ways:

* Creating a cron schedule or an interval schedule
* Displaying information about all the schedules
* Modifying a cron schedule or an interval schedule
* Deleting a cron schedule or an interval schedule
+
You cannot delete a schedule that is currently in use by a running job.

The cluster administrator can perform all the schedule management tasks.
