[.lead]
You can use System Manager to add a cloud tier to an SSD aggregate or a virtual machine disk (VMDK) aggregate. Cloud tiers provide storage for infrequently used data.

* You must have the access key ID and secret key to connect to the object store.
* You must have created a bucket inside the object store.
* Network connectivity must exist between the cluster and the cloud tier.
* If communication between the cloud tier and the cluster is encrypted using SSL or TLS, the required certificates must be installed.

The following object stores can be used as cloud tiers:

* StorageGRID
* Alibaba Cloud (Starting with System Manager 9.6)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Commercial Cloud Service (C2S)
* Microsoft Azure Blob storage
* IBM Cloud
* Google Cloud

[NOTE]
====

* Azure Stack, which is an on-premises Azure service, is not supported.
* If you want to use any object store as a cloud tier, other than StorageGRID, you must have the FabricPool capacity license. You can add the license by clicking *Add License*.
* If you want to use an IBM Cloud Object Storage environment (such as Cleversafe), with FabricPool, you should specify a certification authority (CA) certificate. You can specify the CA certificate by moving the *Object Store Certificate* toggle button and specifying the certificate credentials.

====

. Click *Storage* > *Aggregates & Disks* > *Cloud Tier*.
. Click *Add*.
+
A dialog box appears that lists all supported object store providers.

. From the list, select the object store provider that you want to designate as the cloud tier.
+
The Add Cloud Tier window is displayed.

. Select a region from the drop-down list in the *Region* field.
+
Based on your selection, the *Service Name (FQDN)* field is automatically populated with the server endpoint.

. Specify the access key ID of the cloud tier, the secret key of the cloud tier, and the container name.
+
If you have selected AWS Commercial Cloud Service (C2S) as the type, you must specify the CAP URL, server CA certificates, and client certificates.

. If you want to modify any of the following settings, then click the Advanced Options icon image:../media/advanced_options.gif[] to display the *Advanced Options* dialog window where you can make the changes:
 ** The port number used to access the cloud tier
 ** Enable or disable the *SSL* option that lets you transfer data securely to the cloud tier
. If you want to add a cloud tier for StorageGRID or you want to use IBM Cloud Object Storage environment (such as Cleversafe) with FabricPool, you should specify a CA certificate. Specify the CA certificate by moving the *Object Store Certificate* toggle button and copying the contents of the certificate. Then paste the certificate contents in the signed certification.
. From the *IPspace* list, select the IPspace that is used to connect to the cloud tier.
. Click *Save* to save the cloud tier.
. Click *Save and Attach Aggregates* to save the cloud tier and to attach aggregates to the cloud tier.
