You can use System Manager to delete a subnet when you no longer require the subnet and you want to reallocate the IP addresses that were assigned to the subnet.

== Before you begin

The subnet that you want to delete must not have any LIFs that are using the IP addresses from the subnet.

== About this task

You cannot use System Manager to delete subnets in the Cluster IPspace. You must use the command-line interface (CLI) instead.

== Steps

. Click *Network* > *Subnets*.
. Select the subnet that you want to delete, and then click *Delete*.
. Select the confirmation check box, and then click *Delete*.
