After you have successfully tested CIFS and NFS client access, you can perform advanced CIFS and NFS configuration or add SAN access.When protocol access is complete, you should protect the root volume of SVM. There are express guides, comprehensive guides, and technical reports to help you achieve these goals.

== CIFS/SMB configuration

You can further configure CIFS access using the following comprehensive guides and technical reports:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/smb-admin/index.html[CIFS management]
+
Describes how to configure and manage file access using the CIFS/SMB protocol.

* http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4191.pdf[NetApp Technical Report 4191: Best Practices Guide for Clustered Data ONTAP 8.2 Windows File Services]
+
Provides a brief overview of SMB implementation and other Windows File Services features with recommendations and basic troubleshooting information for ONTAP.

* http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-3740.pdf[NetApp Technical Report 3740: SMB 2 Next-Generation CIFS Protocol in Data ONTAP]
+
Describes SMB 2 features, configuration details, and its implementation in ONTAP.

== NFS configuration

You can further configure NFS access using the following comprehensive guides and technical reports:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-admin/index.html[NFS management]
+
Describes how to configure and manage file access using the NFS protocol.

* http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4067.pdf[NetApp Technical Report 4067: NFS Best Practice and Implementation Guide]
+
Serves as an NFSv3 and NFSv4 operational guide and provides an overview of ONTAP operating system with a focus on NFSv4.

+
Describes the best practices that should be followed while implementing NFSv4 components on AIX, Linux, or Solaris clients attached to systems running ONTAP.

== Root volume protection

After configuring protocols on the SVM, you should ensure that its root volume is protected:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/data-protection/index.html[Data protection]
+
Describes how to create a load-sharing mirror to protect the SVM root volume, which is a NetApp best practice for NAS-enabled SVMs. Also describes how to quickly recover from volume failures or losses by promoting the SVM root volume from a load-sharing mirror
