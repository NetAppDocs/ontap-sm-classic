This content describes how to quickly protect a source volume on a peered ONTAP cluster in preparation for disaster recovery. You should use this content if you want to configure and monitor SnapMirror relationships between peered clusters for volume disaster recovery and do not need a lot of conceptual background for the tasks.

SnapMirror provides scheduled asynchronous, block-level data protection. SnapMirror replicates Snapshot copies and can replicate NAS or SAN volumes on which deduplication, data compression, or both are run, including volumes containing qtrees and LUNs. SnapMirror configuration information is stored in a database that ONTAP replicates to all the nodes in the cluster.

You should use this content if you want to create SnapMirror relationships for volume-level disaster recovery in the following way:

* You are working with clusters running ONTAP 9.
* You are a cluster administrator.
* You have configured the cluster peer relationship and the SVM peer relationship.

* You have enabled the SnapMirror license on both the source and the destination clusters.
* You want to use default policies and schedules, and not create custom policies.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You want to use System Manager, not the ONTAP command-line interface or an automated scripting tool.
* You want to use the _Classic_ System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases, not the ONTAP System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and later.

Provides the set of commands for configuring and managing SnapMirror relationships. You might want to use the SnapMirror commands to write a script that creates multiple SnapMirror relationships.
