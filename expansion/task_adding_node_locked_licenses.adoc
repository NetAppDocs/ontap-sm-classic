If the cluster has features that use node-locked licenses (which entitle only specific nodes to the licensed functionality), you must ensure that node-locked licenses are installed for the new nodes. You should add the licenses before the nodes are joined to the cluster.

== Steps

. Add each license key by using the `system license add` command.
+
----
cluster1::> system license add -license-code AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
----

. View the existing licenses by using the `system license show` command.
+
----
cluster1::> system license show

Serial Number: 9-99-999999
Owner: cluster1
Package           Type    Description           Expiration

. Review the output to ensure that a node-locked license is displayed for all serial numbers, including serial numbers for existing and new nodes.
