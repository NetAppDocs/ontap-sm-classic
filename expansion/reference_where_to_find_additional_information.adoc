After you expand a cluster, you can start storing data on the new nodes either by creating new volumes on the new nodes or by moving existing data to the new nodes.

If you are using SnapMirror or SnapVault relationships in your cluster to protect your data, see the link:../peering/index.html[Cluster and SVM peering configuration] guide to set up appropriate intercluster LIFs for your new nodes.

If you want to move data to the newly added nodes, you can use the following information:

+
Describes how to configure and manage the iSCSI, FCoE, and FC protocols for clustered SAN environments, including configuration of LUNs, igroups, and targets.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/volumes/index.html[Logical storage management^]
+
Describes how to manage logical storage resources in clusters, including FlexVol volumes, FlexClone volumes, files and LUNs, and FlexCache volumes, using deduplication, compression, qtrees, and quotas.
