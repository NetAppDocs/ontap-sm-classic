You can quickly restore a volume from a SnapVault backup in ONTAP when there is a data loss.

You should use this procedure if you want to restore from the SnapVault backup in the following way:

* You are working with clusters running ONTAP 9.
* You are a cluster administrator.
* You have configured the SnapVault relationship following the procedure described in link:../volume-backup-snapvault/index.html[Volume backup using SnapVault]

* You do not want to perform a single file or LUN restore.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You want to use the _Classic_ System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases, not the ONTAP System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and later.
