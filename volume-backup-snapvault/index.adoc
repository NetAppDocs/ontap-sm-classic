You can quickly configure SnapVault backup relationships between volumes that are located in different clusters. The SnapVault backup contains a set of read-only backup copies, which are located on a destination volume that you can use for restoring data when data is corrupted or lost.

You should use this procedure if you want to create SnapVault backup relationships for volumes in the following way:

* You are working with clusters running ONTAP 9.
* You are a cluster administrator.
* You have configured the cluster peer relationship and the SVM peer relationship.

link:../peering/index.html[Cluster and SVM peering configuration]

* You must have enabled either the SnapMirror or SnapVault license, after all of the nodes in the cluster have been upgraded to the same version of ONTAP 9.
* You want to use default protection policies and schedules, and not create custom policies.
* You do not want to back up data for a single file or LUN restore.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You want to use System Manager, not the ONTAP command-line interface or an automated scripting tool.
* You want to use the _Classic_ System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases, not the ONTAP System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and later.
