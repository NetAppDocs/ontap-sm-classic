When you are ready, you can give select clients access to the share by setting UNIX file permissions on a UNIX administration host and adding an export rule in System Manager. Then you should test that the affected users or groups can access the volume.

. Decide which clients and users or groups will be given access to the share.
. On a UNIX administration host, use the root user to set UNIX ownership and permissions on the volume.
. In System Manager, add rules to the export policy to permit NFS clients to access the share.
 .. Select the storage virtual machine (SVM), and click *SVM Settings*.
 .. In the *Policies* pane, click *Export Policies*.
 .. Select the export policy with the same name as the volume.
 .. In the *Export Rules* tab, click *Add*, and specify a set of clients.
 .. Select *2* for the *Rule Index* so that this rule executes after the rule that allows access to the administration host.
 .. Select *NFSv3*.
 .. Specify the access details that you want, and click *OK.*

You can give full read/write access to clients by typing the subnet `10.1.1.0/24` as the *Client Specification*, and selecting all the access check boxes except *Allow Superuser Access*.

. On a UNIX client, log in as one of the users who now has access to the volume, and verify that you can mount the volume and create a file.
