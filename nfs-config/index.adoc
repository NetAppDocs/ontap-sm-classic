This content describes how to quickly set up NFS access to a new volume on either a new or existing storage virtual machine (SVM).

You should use this content if you want to configure access to a volume in the following way:

* NFS access will be through NFSv3, not NFSv4 or NFSv4.1.
* You want to use best practices, not explore every available option.
* You do not want to read a lot of conceptual background.
* You want to use the _Classic_ System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and earlier releases, not the ONTAP System Manager UI for ONTAP 9.7 and later.
* Your data network uses the default IPspace, the default broadcast domain, and the default failover group.
+
If your data network is flat, using these default objects ensures that LIFs will fail over correctly in the event of a link failure. If you are not using the default objects, you should refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/index.html[Network Management Documentation^] for information on how to configure LIF path failover.

* UNIX file permissions will be used to secure the new volume.
* LDAP, if used, is provided by Active Directory.
