When a new LUN is first accessed by the Windows host, it has no partition or file system. You must initialize the LUN, and optionally format it with a file system.

The LUN must have been discovered by the Windows host.

LUNs appear in Windows Disk Management as disks.

You can initialize the disk as a basic disk with a GPT or MBR partition table.

You typically format the LUN with a file system such as NTFS, but some applications use raw disks instead.

. Start Windows Disk Management.
. Right-click the LUN, and then select the required disk or partition type.
. Follow the instructions in the wizard.

If you choose to format the LUN as NTFS, you must select the *Perform a quick format* check box.
